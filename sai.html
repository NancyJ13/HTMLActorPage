He was the first player to win the Stanley Cup four years in a row, from 1920 to 1923, three times with the Senators and once as an injury replacement player with the Toronto St. Patricks. After his playing career he served as a coach and manager, working with the Montreal Maroons from 1925 until 1929, and winning the Stanley Cup in 1926.
